# Semi-Automated Image Quantification of Cell Proliferation in Gilt Uterus Tissue

This repository contains two MATLAB scripts developed for image-based segmentation and quantification of cell proliferation in gilt uterus tissue, using histological images stained with Ki67. This project was completed under the mentorship of **Dr. Uduak George** at **San Diego State University**, in collaboration with colleagues at **Purdue University**.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to automate the quantification of proliferating versus non-proliferating cells in gilt uterus tissue, collected during a study on postnatal colostrum intake. Two MATLAB algorithms were developed:

1. **Image Segmentation**
   Segments tissue into mucosa, connective, and muscle regions using hand-drawn ROIs.

2. **Cell Area Quantification** 
   Applies color thresholding to Ki67-stained images to calculate the area of proliferating and non-proliferating cells.

This research was part of a broader effort to understand how early colostrum intake (10% vs 20% of body weight) affects postnatal tissue growth and potential fertility in gilts.

## ðŸ“š Scientific Background

- **Sample source**: Gilt uteri from Purdue University's swine research farm  
- **Staining**: Ki67 for proliferating cells, H&E as visual reference  
- **Treatment groups**: COL10 and COL20, based on % body weight in colostrum intake  
- **Analysis**: Boxplots, t-tests, and random forest classification used to assess impact  
- **Findings**: No statistically significant difference in proliferation between groups, but biological trends and other significant indicators (e.g., immunocrit, TEMP-24H) were revealed

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- MATLAB (R2020b - Version 9.9.0.1467703)
- Image Processing Toolbox (Version 11.2)
- Color Thresholder App (HSV-based masking)
- Adobe Photoshop (for panorama assembly)

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open MATLAB (2020b or newer with Image Processing Toolbox).
2. Place your `.tif` images in `/sample_images/`.
3. Run:
   - `roi_mask_generation.m` to segment tissue types
   - `proliferation_analysis_roi.m` to calculate cell area ratios
4. Output Excel files and segmented images will appear in `/results/`.
