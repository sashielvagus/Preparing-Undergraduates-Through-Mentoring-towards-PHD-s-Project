# Preparing Undergraduates Through Mentoring Towards PhD's – Image-Based Quantification

This repository contains two MATLAB scripts developed to support the image-based quantification of proliferating versus non-proliferating cells in biological tissue samples. The work was conducted by **Sashiel Vagus** and **Brooke Tyler** under the mentorship of **Dr. Uduak George** at **San Diego State University**, in collaboration with researchers at **Purdue University**.

## 📌 Project Summary

The purpose of this project is to assist in automating the determination of the ratio of proliferating to non-proliferating cells within a given tissue. The original study focused on gilt uterus tissue samples, with separate tissue classifications. A unique image segmentation script was developed to isolate tissue types based on hand-drawn Regions of Interest (ROIs), and a masking script was used to quantify tissue area.

Depending on the user's needs, the two codes may be executed independently or together. The tissue area masking code also generates an Excel file listing the order and measurement of segmented areas.
